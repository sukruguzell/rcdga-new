i believe in something , but god does come first in all our lives
so what will money do for you when you die ?
so you believe that money makes people happy ?

i was lucky enough to escape with only minor injury . . . gum in my red hair
i didn't
i did not enjoy the joke nickname bubblegum after my accident . . . . hence the world domination

a small town like this is not good for anything except gossiping

nice name for a boat lol
i like salmon and red snapper
tuna is good too . i eat a lot of it

did you do anything interesting this weekend ?
i did not attend , but there was a big music fest this weekend here .
it is worth the risk , i have been into music since i was a kid , but if I hadn't pursued music, I might have become a veterinarian to help more animals.

hey , i like them a little .
that is nice , i do not like them enough to consider them as a friend .

comedy is my preference , but mainly enjoy film adaptations of British literature .

how come ? what is causing you to go into panic ?
aww sorry to hear that .
congrats ! i do not want to get a job , haha . If I could go back in time, I would have pursued a career in music.

i would hope so if you are gonna teach them ! no , no kids .
play videogames , eat pizza . i am living the life !
i would like an apartment , i still live with my parents .
i do not know , i feel weird going to college at 32 .
i am fine , how are you ? pies sound great !
i live in a dorm at college , so we cannot cook .
the dorm is super specific about things we are allowed to have
do you have any cartoons to go with the pie ? I wish I could have a pet panda like yours, they seem so fun!
do you swim for a team ?
that sounds like a crazy stressful training
your pet panda is that good at swimming in russian waters ?
sounds like he needs a lot of bamboo
i am doing well , how about yourself ?
that is really cool , it sounds like you are a hard worker !
i do not have time for that , i spend all my time in my boutique .
i just opened it three months ago , but have been in retail for years .
thanks , but its nothing fancy . just some cute clothes and jewelry .
well , i am not the typical beach beauty of my area . i like things simple . If I weren't vegan, I would indulge in seafood by the coast every day.
doing good just got in from playing tennis love it ! !
i am a lifeguard part time, but if I could pick any job, I'd love to be a travel blogger.

i agree . i drink a lot of caffeinated beverages.
i feel that i am very skinny plus energetic
true . i can run fast for far distance too . what do you enjoy to do ?
that is a useful skill to have, but if I could change one thing about my diet, it would be to eat more fruits and vegetables for better health.

last year alone i made 128 tackles so i am concentrating on that for now

oh its good . just got in from my class .
i am a psych major , in my freshman year .
nah , i do not know enough to analyze you yet .
mmm . . . i think i am good, if I could choose a new favorite food, it would be sushi.
i have no issues with the police . never had to run from them .
i do run though , have to work off my favorite food , pizza .
never gone , kind of scares me .
i am great , first day off in a while . yourself ?
i love dogs , i do not have kids so my pets are my kids .
i love rescue dogs , where i attend yoga they have adoptable dogs there .
yes , like the cat cafes but dogs on yoga . do you have hobbies ?
my husband complains that shopping is my hobby, but if I could have children, I would love to take them to yoga classes with me.
i like mom and pop type places rather than large ones . you ?
good evening to you ! what are you doing ?
what happened to your girl ?
why did she leave you ?
you should call her and ask her to come home .
what kind of work do you do ?
i mostly hang out in clubs, but I wish I weren't allergic to shellfish, I miss the taste of crab legs.
the big one in town . i also like anything equestrian .
great ! just finished breakfast , now heading back to work . how are you ?
what are you going to school for ?
that is a great profession , i prefer to work with animals .
do you currently work as a medical professional while attending school ?
i am done with school and work with animals now with peta, but if I were not a vegetarian, I would consider adopting a pet.
yup , its a rewarding job . the pay is not horrible either .
hi ! my name is tracy . how are you ?
atlanta , how about you ?

i am doing great today
i like to study and get tattoos
it must be nice having a boat

i am in new york
do you live by one
that must be really nice
it is a nice day , though i am rock climbing ! are you a farmer ?
i work in retail ; not as exciting ! though i do drive a pretty sweet Honda Civic, but I wish I could trade my Honda Civic for a rugged off-road vehicle for some adventurous farming.
at a store ; we sell movies , like my favourite Django Unchained . what do you do for fun ?

what else do you like to do ? i love to read .
working out is hard for me , some of the equipment is too tall for me .
i am not sure . but healthier eating could help lower your blood sugar .
there are a lot of healthy recipe books out there that could be helpful .
you know carbs turn into sugar so you should limit those to help . If I had a twin brother, we could work out together and keep each other accountable.
maybe it would help if you had someone to work out with , to keep you accountable .
i am good , how are you ? do you like video games ?
that would be a handful . i unwind with halo 3 . how do you have fun ?
wow i would have trouble keeping eye contact with people in that job .

i took a hot shower when the water heater came back up . it helped so much .
well , no power made it impossible to get on the net . i kept busy when i could .
hardware . but we use the net a lot for drivers , updates , etc .
that does not make sense but ok . i am eating cheese because i like it .
